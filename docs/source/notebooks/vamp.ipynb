    "\n",
    "For users already familiar with the VAMP interface: The corresponding [API docs](../api/generated/sktime.decomposition.VAMP.rst#sktime.decomposition.VAMP).\n",
    "\n",
    "VAMP is short for [V]ariational [A]pproach for [M]arkov [P]rocesses and was introduced in <cite data-cite=\"nbvamp-wu2020variational\">(Wu, 2020)</cite>. It can be used as linear dimensionality reduction tool and extends [TICA](tica.ipynb) in the sense that it gives rise to a systematic way to select input features as well as handles off-equilibrium data consistently.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the VAMP model possesses methods to project data into lower dimensions, it also is equipped with scoring functions (the so-called VAMP scores), which allow ranking of features. This has been demonstrated in, e.g., <cite data-cite=\"nbvamp-scherer2019variational\">(Scherer, 2019)</cite>.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to estimate a VAMP model, a Koopman operator $\\mathcal{K}_\\tau$ is estimated, which describes conditional future expectation values for a fixed lag time $\\tau$. Its action on a function $g$ can be written as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathcal{K}_\\tau g(x) = \\int p(y\\mid x)(y) dy = \\mathbb{E}[g(x_{t+\\tau} | x_t = x) ],$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $p(y \\mid x)$ is the conditional probability density that a point $y$ at time $t+\\tau$ is visited given that point $x$ was visited at time $t$. Making the ansatz that $g$ is a linear combination $g = \\sum_i w_i \\chi_i$ for some basis functions $\\chi_i$, the linear operator $\\mathcal{K}_\\tau$ can be expressed as matrix $K$. It can be shown <cite data-cite=\"nbvamp-wu2020variational\">(Wu, 2020)</cite>, that the dominant eigenfunctions of an SVD of the Koopman operator in a whitenend basis $\\bar K$ yields the best dynamical model for a given timeseries, which is also what is computed and projected on in estimator and model, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "VAMP deals with off-equilibrium cases consistently, which can be divided into three subcategories (as presented in :cite:`ix-dimredux-koltai2018optimal`):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Time-inhomogeneous dynamics*, e.g, the observed system is driven by a time-dependent external force,\n",
    "2. *Time-homogeneous non-reversible dynamics*, i.e., detailed balance is not obeyed and the observations might be\n",
    "   of a non-stationary regime.\n",
    "3. *Reversible dynamics but non-stationary data*, i.e., the system possesses a stationary distribution with respect\n",
    "   to which it obeys detailed balance, but the empirical of the available data did not converge to this stationary\n",
    "   distribution.\n",
    "   \n",
    "The third of the described cases is salvageable with TICA when a special reweighting procedure\n",
