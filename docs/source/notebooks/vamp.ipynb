    "# VAMP\n",
    "\n",
    "For users already familiar with the VAMP interface: The corresponding [API docs](../api/generated/deeptime.decomposition.VAMP.rst#deeptime.decomposition.VAMP).\n",
    "\n",
    "VAMP is short for [V]ariational [A]pproach for [M]arkov [P]rocesses and was introduced in <cite data-cite=\"nbvamp-wu2020variational\">(Wu, 2020)</cite>. It can be used as linear dimensionality reduction tool and extends [TICA](tica.ipynb) in the sense that it gives rise to a systematic way to select input features as well as handles off-equilibrium data consistently. The method is a form of canonical correlation analysis <cite data-cite=\"nbvamp-hotelling1992relations\">(Hotelling, 1992)</cite> (originally presented in 1935) in time, also called temporal canonical correlation analysis (TCCA).\n",
    "\n",
    "While the VAMP model possesses methods to project data into lower dimensions, it also is equipped with scoring functions (the so-called VAMP scores), which allow ranking of features. This has been demonstrated in, e.g., <cite data-cite=\"nbvamp-scherer2019variational\">(Scherer, 2019)</cite>.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to estimate a VAMP model, a Koopman operator $\\mathcal{K}_\\tau$ is estimated, which describes conditional future expectation values for a fixed lag time $\\tau$. Its action on a function $g$ can be written as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathcal{K}_\\tau g(x) = \\int p(y\\mid x)(y) dy = \\mathbb{E}[g(x_{t+\\tau} | x_t = x) ],$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $p(y \\mid x)$ is the conditional probability density that a point $y$ at time $t+\\tau$ is visited given that point $x$ was visited at time $t$. Making the ansatz that $g$ is a linear combination $g = \\sum_i w_i \\chi_i$ for some basis functions $\\chi_i$, the linear operator $\\mathcal{K}_\\tau$ can be expressed as matrix $K$. It can be shown <cite data-cite=\"nbvamp-wu2020variational\">(Wu, 2020)</cite>, that the dominant eigenfunctions of an SVD of the Koopman operator in a whitenend basis $\\bar K$ yields the best dynamical model for a given timeseries, which is also what is computed and projected on in estimator and model, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "VAMP deals with off-equilibrium cases consistently, which can be divided into three subcategories (as presented in :cite:`ix-dimredux-koltai2018optimal`):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Time-inhomogeneous dynamics*, e.g, the observed system is driven by a time-dependent external force,\n",
    "2. *Time-homogeneous non-reversible dynamics*, i.e., detailed balance is not obeyed and the observations might be\n",
    "   of a non-stationary regime.\n",
    "3. *Reversible dynamics but non-stationary data*, i.e., the system possesses a stationary distribution with respect\n",
    "   to which it obeys detailed balance, but the empirical of the available data did not converge to this stationary\n",
    "   distribution.\n",
    "   \n",
    "The third of the described cases is salvageable with TICA when a special reweighting procedure\n",
    "(`Koopman reweighting <notebooks/tica.ipynb#Koopman-reweighting>`_) is used."
