    "VAMP is short for [V]ariational [A]pproach for [M]arkov [P]rocesses and was introduced in <cite data-cite=\"wu2020variational\">(Wu, 2020)</cite>. It can be used as linear dimensionality reduction tool and extends [TICA](tica.ipynb) in the sense that it gives rise to a systematic way to select input features as well as handles off-equilibrium data consistently.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the VAMP model possesses methods to project data into lower dimensions, it also is equipped with scoring functions (the so-called VAMP scores), which allow ranking of features. This has been demonstrated in, e.g., <cite data-cite=\"scherer2019variational\">(Scherer, 2019)</cite>."
