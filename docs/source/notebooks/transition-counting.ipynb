    "# Transition counting\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin estimating markov state models one needs to collect statistics over available data, in particular transitions between states at a given lag time $\\tau$.\n",
    "\n",
    "These statistics can be collected using deeptime's transition count estimator ([apidocs](../api/generated/deeptime.markov.TransitionCountEstimator.rst#deeptime.markov.TransitionCountEstimator)).\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating an instance of said estimator, one has to make two choices: The lagtime $\\tau > 0$ and the count mode. The lag time is the step size of the markov chain, i.e, an underlying transition matrix of the process with\n",
    "\n",
    "$$  P_{ij} = \\mathbb{P}(X_{t+\\tau}=j \\mid X_t = i). $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The count mode can be one of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `\"sample\"`: Strides the trajectory with lagtime $\\tau$ and uses the strided counts as transitions, i.e., a trajectory of length $T$ has $\\lfloor T/\\tau \\rfloor$ counts at time indices\n",
    "   $$ (0 \\rightarrow \\tau), (\\tau \\rightarrow 2 \\tau), ..., (((T/ \\tau )-1) \\tau \\rightarrow T). $$\n",
    "   This means that potentially transitions can be missed.\n",
    "- `\"sliding\"`: Uses a sliding window approach for counting. A trajectory of length $T$ has $T-\\tau$ transition counts at \n",
    "   $$ (0 \\rightarrow \\tau), (1 \\rightarrow \\tau+1), ..., (T-\\tau-1 \\rightarrow T-1). $$\n",
    "   This introduces an overestimation of the actual count values by a factor of \"lagtime\". For maximum-likelihood MSMs this plays no role but it leads to wrong error bars in uncertainty estimation.\n",
    "- `\"sliding-effective\"`: Same as sliding mode, just that the resulting count matrix is divided by the lagtime after counting. This which can be shown to provide a likelihood that is the geometrical average over shifted subsamples of the trajectory, $(s_1,\\:s_{tau+1},\\:...),\\:(s_2,\\:t_{tau+2},\\:...)$, etc. This geometrical average converges to the correct likelihood in the statistical limit <cite data-cite=\"nbtransitions-trendelkamp2015estimation\">(Trendelkamp-Schroer, 2015)</cite>.\n",
    "- `\"effective\"`: Uses an estimate of the transition counts that are statistically uncorrelated. Recommended when used with a [Bayesian MSM](./mlmsm.ipynb) (or the respective [API docs](../api/generated/deeptime.markov.msm.BayesianMSM.rst#deeptime.markov.msm.BayesianMSM)). A description of the estimation procedure can be found in <cite data-cite=\"nbtransitions-noe2015statistical\">(No√©, 2015)</cite>."
