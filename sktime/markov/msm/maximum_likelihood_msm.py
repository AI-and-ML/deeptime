        Constructs a new maximum-likelihood msm estimator.

        Parameters
        ----------
        reversible : bool, optional, default=True
            If true compute reversible MarkovStateModel, else non-reversible MarkovStateModel
        stationary_distribution_constraint : (N,) ndarray, optional, default=None
            Stationary vector on the full set of states. Estimation will be made such the the resulting transition
            matrix has this distribution as an equilibrium distribution. Set probabilities to zero if the states which
            should be excluded from the analysis.
        sparse : bool, optional, default=False
            If true compute count matrix, transition matrix and all derived quantities using sparse matrix algebra.
            In this case python sparse matrices will be returned by the corresponding functions instead of numpy arrays.
            This behavior is suggested for very large numbers of states (e.g. > 4000) because it is likely to be much
            more efficient.
        allow_disconnected : bool, optional, default=False
            If set to true, the resulting transition matrix may have disconnected and transient states, and the
            estimated stationary distribution is only meaningful on the respective connected sets.
        maxiter : int, optional, default=1000000
            Optional parameter with reversible = True, sets the maximum number of iterations before the transition
            matrix estimation method exits.
        maxerr : float, optional, default = 1e-8
            Optional parameter with reversible = True. Convergence tolerance for transition matrix estimation. This
            specifies the maximum change of the Euclidean norm of relative stationary probabilities
            (:math:`x_i = \sum_k x_{ik}`). The relative stationary probability changes
            :math:`e_i = (x_i^{(1)} - x_i^{(2)})/(x_i^{(1)} + x_i^{(2)})` are used in order to track changes in small
            probabilities. The Euclidean norm of the change vector, :math:`|e_i|_2`, is compared to maxerr.
